# HelloWorldAPI
Test for Hello World

Problem:

Naga – Could you  please complete the below test,  upload the source code into GitHub and send me the link.

Write a ‘Hello World’ program

The program has 1 current business requirement – write “Hello World” to the console/screen.
The program should have an API that is separated from the program logic to eventually support mobile applications, web applications, or console applications, or windows services.
The program should support future enhancements for writing to a database, console application, etc.
Use common design patterns (inheritance, e.g.) to account for these future concerns.
Use configuration files or another industry-standard mechanism for determining where to write the information to.
 Write unit tests to support the API.


Solution:

Created the HellowWorldWebAPI, ConsoleApplication, HelloWorldHelper and Unit Test Projects.
Created the Data to read from the Text file.


Time Taken to Complete:

Total Time = 1 hour 30 mins

Requirements, Problem Understanding = 15 mins

Design & Planning = 30 mins

Coding = 30 mins

Unit Testing & Testing = 15 mins


Area's to improve:

1. Can implement with API Token to deal with proper request and response.
2. ConsoleApplication can be used with WebAPI service with Requests & response.
3. Can create the Datebase handler.
